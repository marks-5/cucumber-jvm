  --[no-]allow-started-ignored           Fire test started before the execution of a
                                         step. This makes it possible to use the
                                         test started and test finished notification
                                         to calculate the execution time of the step.
                                         If the step is pending the test started will
                                         be followed by a test ignored, which can
                                         confuse some listeners.
