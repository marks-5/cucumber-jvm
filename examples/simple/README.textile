h1. Cucumber Java Simple example

This project is a very basic example that illustrates how to use Cucumber with
Java, writing step definitions in pure Java.

h2. Prerequisites

* Install JRuby (1.2.0 or newer)
* jruby -S gem install cucumber-java
* Download PicoContainer and JUnit jars
** See features/support/env.rb for details. You may have to change the paths there depending on where you put jars.

h2. Running it

h3. Build the java code

<pre>
mvn clean compile jar:jar
</pre>

h3. Run the features:

<pre>
jruby -S cucumber features
</pre>

Try to make the features fail by modifying the java code or the feature file - check out the output...

See the "Cucumber Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber for more info.

h2. Hacking

If you want to hack on the cucumber-java gem and use this example as a testbed, it's easier to run off 
cucumber and cucumber-java as "source" instead of gems.
Here is what I do:

<pre>
jruby -I../../lib PATH_TO_CUCUMBER_SRC/bin/cucumber features
</pre>
