h1. Have a Cuke, Duke

Cucumber-Java lets you write Cucumber steps in pure Java. Example:

<pre>
public class StuffSteps {
    @Given("I have (\\d+) (.*) cukes")
    public void iHaveNCukes(String n, String color) {
        this.cukes.put(color, n);
    }
}
</pre>

Cucumber-Java also brings you first-class Maven support.
