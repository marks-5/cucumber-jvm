h2. Registering classes

Cucumber can easily be extended by implementing various interfaces and telling Cucumber where to find them.

This is done simply with:

  Cucumber cucumber = new Cucumber("my.package", "my.other.package");

Cucumber will scan those packages for implementations of:

* Step Definitions (Java)
* Hooks
* ObjectFactory
* Transforms
* Formatters

h2. TODO before release

* Print snippets
* Print stats (only for certain formatters)
* Export cucumber.json with stepdefs and usage
* Support Hooks
* Run Hooks in order
* Support ambiguous
* Convert args
* Handle multiline args
* Add diffing
* Support no-skip
* Use locale from feature in transformations
* Ensure we can pass line numbers
* Ensure we can pass line tags
* Ensure we can pass line names/regexen
* Ant task (POJO)
* Maven plugin
* Port examples
* [OKish - needs polishing in prettyformatter] Outlines
* [OK] Put duration in results
* [OK] Autodiscover ObjectFactory
* [OK] Ensure we can run single feature files

h2. Release 2
* Dry run

h2. Printing examples tables
