h2. Registering classes

Cucumber can easily be extended by implementing various interfaces and telling Cucumber where to find them.

This is done simply with:

  Cucumber cucumber = new Cucumber("my.package", "my.other.package");

Cucumber will scan those packages for implementations of:

  * Step Definitions (Java)
  * Hooks
  * ObjectFactory
  * Transforms
  * Formatters
