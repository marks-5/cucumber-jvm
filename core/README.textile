h2. Registering classes

Cucumber can easily be extended by implementing various interfaces and telling Cucumber where to find them.

This is done simply with:

  Cucumber cucumber = new Cucumber("my.package", "my.other.package");

Cucumber will scan those packages for implementations of:

* Step Definitions (Java)
* Hooks
* ObjectFactory
* Transforms
* Formatters

h2. TODO before release

* Merge Core, TCK, TCK-Java, Junit, Picocontainer(?) into Core.
* Export cucumber.json with stepdefs and usage
* Support Hooks
* Run Hooks in order
* Support ambiguous
* Convert args to right types
* Handle multiline args
* Add diffing
* Support no-skip
* Use locale from feature in transformations
* CLI Ensure we can pass line numbers
* CLI Ensure we can pass line tags
* CLI Ensure we can pass line names/regexen
* I18n for all backends
* Ant task (POJO)
